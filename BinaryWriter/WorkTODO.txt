RECORD WRITING
- Edit record, hold pointers

AVANZATE:
- In-memory pointer map, block map
- #fulprt Multiple partitions management
- Find record by condition on fields
- #morrec Remote, embedded records

MISC.
- Singleton GuidEmpty for performance
- Check RNG seed quality (seems to always start at same address - might be a "dev" build issue)
- Instead of exposing IDBType.Field, consider using a contract
- Consider implementing protection from malicious corruption of pointer type
- Exceptions cleanup
- Core interface cleanup
